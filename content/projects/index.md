## Personal Website

The website you are looking at right now was created for the purpose of showing my personal projects and write guides on things that I find interesting. A cool little feature the website has is the button you see in the upper-right corner which changes the website from dark-mode to light-mode and viceversa. Please take a look around and contact me if you have any questions.
